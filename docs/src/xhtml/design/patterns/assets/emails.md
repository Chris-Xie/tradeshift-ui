# Emails

Points to keep in mind:

* Have exactly one message in your email
* Be concise and to the point of why did the user receive this email, what (re)action is expected from the user and which other party triggered the email to be sent
* Present the most expected action as a [primary action button](http://ui.tradeshift.com/#design/copy/buttons.html) just below the introductory text
* Donâ€™t advertise. All promotion is managed by Tradeshift and sent out through opt-in newsletters. Application emails are for actions/app-events only. Irrelevant content dilute the signal-strength from other Tradeshift emails
* Make your emails work on mobile devices
