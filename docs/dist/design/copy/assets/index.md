# UI Copy

Copy is an aspect of UI design that is often left by the wayside, or not given enough emphasis. With a product that handles both sensitive and complicated processes, it is essential that the design principles and rules laid out in this guide are adequately supported by strong copy. This page and sub-pages act as a self-contained UI copy guide. The goal of these pages is to provide both designers and developers with tools and rules to create strong copy that supports the design goals of Tradeshift.
