#Full page apps

Apps may run with the Tradeshift navigation interface (the chrome) visually hidden, while still technically running inside the Tradeshift chrome â€“ and showing the Tradeshift URL in the address bar.

One example is the supplier registration application below. This application takes over the full viewport while running on Tradeshift.

Under normal conditions any app should rarely have the need to take over the full viewport. The approach is also only recommended for flows where new users need to perform certain actions before using Tradeshift. Expect users who are used to using Tradeshift to want to have access to the global navigation.
