descriptive just like this subheader Buttons are crucial when it comes to copy for two reasons First they are one of the main ways in which users interact with the product Whenever a button is pressed something will happen Second buttons are among the most spacelimited elements in the UI which means that button copy needs to be extremely sharp With this in mind buttons on Tradeshift need to have two specific qualities they need to be collectively consistent and individually descriptive What does this mean Collectively consistent It is essential that the user can recognize buttons as such This is in large part made true through visual design x2013 therex2019s a very limited and well defined set of possibilities for how buttons should look However this can also be strengthened by button copy being consistent in terms of how it relates to its context We achieve this through the following rules The button that begins the flow must work together with the one that ends it to make the flow a selfcontained unit All actions on Tradeshift that result in flows that require more than one step have two buttons that act as quotgatesquot x2013 one to initialize the flow and one to finalize it The copy on these two buttons should be written with this in mind As a general rule if the opening button contains an action x2018Reject documentx2019 then the same verb should be present in the finalizing button On the other hand buttons that do not include an action for example quotSettingsquot can have a more generic finalizer such as quotDonequot If a button results in the opening of a new page or a picker the title of said page or picker must be consistent with the name of the button So a button that reads x201CReject connection requestx201D should not lead to a picker that reads x201Cselect valuex201D In very specific cases the title of the destination can read differently from the button but in 999 of cases they should read exactly the same For more specific information about titles in pickers and their relationship with the buttons that trigger them see the page on Menu Pickers Individually descriptive Whilst we want buttons to be consistent in how they relate to their context we also want them to be tailored to this context This means that as a general rule we do not want generic nondescript buttons that read x2018proceedx2019 x2018continuex2019 x2018donex2019 or x2018backx2019 Rather the copy on a button should be as descriptive as possible in terms of what the button will achieve of course within the length restraints implied Following the rule of thumb from the principle above if the button is related to an action then always use the verb in the button Furthermore if the verb is an action that can have multiple logical objects then include the object as well for example x2018Rejectx2019 can refer to documents connections and potentially more so describe what is being rejected Continue reading about our UI Copy Guidelines on the

Development Process When it comes to producing good copy embedding it into the development process is just as important as following the principles guidelines and rules If writing copy is not taken seriously as a task and allocated adequate time resources and interest the end result will not be good The following guidelines should help each product team to incorporate copywriting into the development process Copywriting is a skill and should ideally be done by the most capable Writing copy is a skill in and of itself and whilst it is related to a number of other skills it is definitely a skill that requires practice effort and knowledge Knowledge of the English language is a necessary but not sufficient skill and even skilled people will produce poor copy when rushed What this means is that each team should allocate copywriting to whoever is the most capable In some teams this might be the designer in others it might be the PM and in others it might be a developer What is important is that this is a conscious decision and not left to be picked up by a stressed PM on the day before release Good copy takes time effort and iterations Again no matter how amazing someone is at writing copy a truly good result can only be achieved through iteration and effort The first drafts for copy should be produced as early as possible in the development process and these should be discussed and iterated on much like everything else Continue reading about our UI Copy Guidelines on the Terminology amp Cheat Sheet pagedevhtml3517 "},{"title":"Emails","href":"design/copy/emails.html","content":" Emails sticky display none important Emails Emails are a crucial and highly complex aspect of the product Get it right When it comes to emails the complexity level is very high for 2 reasons There are many fields that must be filled with text sender subject headers body buttons explanations Emails are consumed in a context outside Tradeshiftx2019s control There are many different types of emails and things like tone etc will vary depending on the goal of the email Wex2019ll now go through the different elements that comprise an email However before doing that two important questions must be asked Is this email necessary What is the goal of this email These questions may seem superfluous but it is important to be sure that only emails that are necessary and useful to the user are sent As such never take for granted that an email should exist At Tradeshift one requirement for an email being deemed necessary is that the email has a call to action for the user x2013 emails that do not encourage the user to take some action are not worth sending As such when answering the second question it is a good idea to keep the call to action in mind x2013 this will help in creating a good and cohesive email Once the purpose and call to action are determined we can proceed to the email itself As far as copy is concerned there are five sections that need to be created in an email sender subject title body and buttons Wex2019ll go through these one at a time Sender This is a simple field where consistency rules There are two options for the sender When the email is a system email that is unrelated to any other user the sender should in most cases be Tradeshift When the email is related to an interaction between users the sender should be the user taking the action that results in an email via Tradeshift Subject Again the way the subject is written will very much depend on the nature of the email Nevertheless the subject is crucial since it plays the biggest role in determining whether the email will be read at all Having amazing copy inside the email is irrelevant if the email is never opened The most important thing to keep in mind is that emails revolve around the Call to Action CTA If an email does not have a relevant and important CTA then it is not worth sending There are two options for how the subject line should relate to the CTA x2013 when the action needed is critical for the continuation of a process and when it is not Note that this dichotomy is not necessarily the same as the action being important in a business sense x2013 an action can be very important businesswise but not be crucial per this definition For example a document being rejected in a small business context is a very important notification in a business sense but it is not critical in terms of being a bottleneck On the other hand a request for changes to a supplier registration form IS critical since the user will not be able to send invoices until the requested changes are made When the action is deemed critical the action should be frontloaded in the email by being the focus of the subject line So in the above example of a customer requesting changes on a supplierx2019s registration form the subject line would read Your Supplier Registration form for customer requires some changes Other examples of subject lines for critical actions could be Action needed x2013 Register to Nike Supplier Network A document needs coding On the other hand when the action is not critical then the subject line should inform the user of the event that has occurred The call to action can then be introduced inside the email Subject lines for these types of email include the following user has sent you an invoice user accepted your connection request Your public profile is missing your logo Title The title section is quite a bit simpler as it is very much tied to the subject line The title should be very descriptive and summarize the purpose of the email for the user What this means is that the title can to a great extent mirror the subject line Following the examples above email titles could read as follows Subject Action needed x2013 Register to Nike Supplier Network Title As a supplier to Nike Inc you must complete the supplier registration on Tradeshift to be able to do business with Nike Subject user has sent you an invoice Title user has sent you an invoice on Tradeshift Body The copy in the body is where the majority of the information is conveyed This copy is also what leads the user to the button with the CTA so this section should provide the user with all of the information they might need to click on the button If the subject and title did not include the call to action you have received an invoice then it can be included here you have received an invoice from X Click the button below to see and accept or reject it If the call to action was included in the subject then this can be repeated along with an explanation of why the CTA is needed Buttons Currently Tradeshift emails typically contain a single button with the main CTA This button should be descriptive and tell the user exactly where in the product they will land In terms of functionality the button should take the user directly to the task needed x2013 they should not have to find their way once they click the button Thus an email informing the user of a new item on their To Do list should have a button leading the user to the item itself and not to the list as a whole As for the rest buttons on emails should follow the same guidelines as buttons in the rest of the product Read more in the buttons guidelines This marks the end of our UI Copy Guidelines and the Design

sticky display none important Error Messages Error messages should be short and amazingly precise embodiments of the copy principles Error messages are extremely important yet they are the ones that are most often done carelessly or as an afterthought Error messages are what stands between a user continuing to be a user when something goes wrong and that user giving the program another chance Error messages are the copy that appears at the worst possible time Whatever it was that the user wanted to achieve was not achieved At best the outcome is irrelevant and at worst work time or worse may have been wasted As such error messages should do everything possible to convince the user to give the software another shot So what should an error message do 1 Be informative and concise Both of these are equally important Both extremes are problematic Too concise results in poor information transfer The most important thing is that the user knows what went wrong and what they should do next An error message that is too concise thus wonapost give enough information For example Something is broken This error message is certainly concise but it does not provide the user with any information besides the fact that their desired and expected outcome did not occur Conversely it can also be that an error message has too much information or information that is not easily decipherable An error message with too much information might read like The backup did not complete successfully An error ocurred The following information might help you resolve the error If an MM error is returned which is not defined in the standard FsRtl filter it is converted to one of the following errors which is guaranteed to be in the filter In this case information is lost however the filter correctly handles the exception 0xC00000EA Backup time 11292006 1157 AMx201D Microsoft The important part is thus to provide enough information to give the user a clear indication of how to proceed but not so much that the user becomes more confused or simply gives up An error message with the right balance of concise and informative could be An error occurred while attempting to send your document Please try again If the issue persists please contact support 2 Keep in mind who is reading the error message Related with the point above You donapost want to give the old lady information that would be interesting for the developer you want to give her the information she needs to solve her problem 3 Indicate the potential next steps Provide the user with the required steps they should take to either remedy the error or to arrive at the intended outcome It is important to always include the next step even when it is not something the user can solve themselves The following series of examples from Tradeshift show how we took a bad error message and iterated it into a good one At its earliest stage the error message looked like this CloudScan encountered an error while processing Document to Recipient This error message is not fantastic It makes it clear to the user which document caused the error and how the outcome differed from the intended but it does not provide the user with any information regarding what she should do next Thus we might change it to CloudScan encountered an error while processing Document to Recipient The most likely reason for this error is that the PDF file is corrupted Make sure that the PDF file can be opened in your PDF viewer This is better even though it is longer It provides the user with a clear action to take in order to solve the problem However it could still be improved As it is right now the most likely explanation is given But what happens if that is not the explanation The user might open the PDF in their reader just fine If this happens then they are in the same place as before without knowing what to do next Of course it can be that after this we do not have a x2018next bestapos explanation However itaposs important to provide the user with a next action In this case we can add one more bit to our error message CloudScan encountered an error while processing Document to Recipient The most likely reason for this error is that the PDF file is corrupted Make sure that the PDF file can be opened in your PDF viewer If the issue persists please contact support It is important to give an action to the user even if we have no

weaposre offering a solution than the user thinking they have to x2018chaseapos support around for a product that should be working in the first place By doing this we alleviate the pain that the user is experiencing due to the error For example this error message was shown when document delivery failed for an unknown reason Unable to send document Now it may very well be that we do not know why

donapost know the cause of the error but two things happen here that didnapost before First we are honest about not knowing this instead of looking lazy Second we encourage the user to ask us for help

might seem obvious but it really is at the core of copy strategy This principle informs all the other ones in this list and every single line of copy on Tradeshift should aim to satisfy this principle Copy should be as concise as possible but clarity should not be sacrificed in favor of brevity Brevity is a good thing but not to the exclusion of everything else Following principle number one above brevity is only good insofar as it leads to informative copy Thus brevity is one extreme of an axis but not the goal An extremely short piece of copy can also be extremely uninformative quotan error occurredquot In such cases increased length is the preferred option in order to achieve maximum information transfer quotan unidentified error occurred during the uploading process Please try again If this problem persists please contact Tradeshift supportquot In terms of tone copy should be friendly and casual but serious Wex2019re new young and exciting but wex2019re still dealing with peoplex2019s businesses money and other serious things This is a fine line to tread x2013 Tradeshift should not be boring and soulless but it still needs to be taken seriously A casual friendly tone is good quotYou havenx2019t added a picture to your profile yet What are you waiting forquot Pop culture references quotThese are not the droids youx2019re looking forquot or even worse internetculture references are not Product copy should still feel natural when spoken out loud If a piece of copy doesnx2019t feel natural in a context of one person explaining something to another then itx2019s not good enough Consistency is critical for a positive customer experience Product copy should be consistent across different parts of the product Marketing messages appearing within the product and emails generated by product activity should also be consistent with product copy to ensure understanding This consistency applies mostly to product names terminology key words and error messages but also applies to tone style punctuation format etc The page Terminology amp Cheat Sheet is the main resource to ensure consistency Product copy should assume as little previously existing knowledge as possible from the user In keeping with design principles Tradeshift users are very rarely expert users and in many cases the tasks they do at Tradeshift are not the principal tasks of their position As such product copy should not assume that the user possesses any deep technical industry or other specific knowledge If it sounds like an engineer talking to another engineer itx2019s not good enough If it sounds like an accountant talking to another itx2019s not good enough If it sounds like a lawyer talking to another lawyer or a lawyer talking to anyone itx2019s not good enough Copywriting is part of good design This means that copy is not something that gets added once a design has been finalized Rather copy is integral to the design process This means that placeholder copy is not good enough This does not mean that copy needs to be perfect from the very first wireframe What it does mean however is that copy cannot be Lorem Ipsum until an hour before deployment It is very much acceptable to write preliminary copy and to iterate on it as the whole design is iterated but copy is as important as layout in terms of providing a good user experience Continue reading about our UI Copy Guidelines on the Handling Copy During Development pageindexhtml3817 "},{"title":"Menu Pickers","href":"design/copy/pickers.html","content":" Menu Pickers sticky display none important Menu Pickers With regards to copy there are three main sections in a picker The title the body and the buttons The layered lists we call Pickers are an essential aspect of how UIs are structured on Tradeshift Given that some of the most important choices on the platform are made through these copy on them is very important This is exacerbated by the fact that due to the layered structure a flow can become quite complex with layers being added and removed many times before the flow is over Thus it is essential for the copy in pickers to do two things 1 keep the user from getting lost and 2 push the action forward The title When it comes to the first objective of picker copy the title pulls most of the weight The title itself then has to do two things First it has to be able to tell the user exactly what needs to be done in this picker This means that somebody who looks at a picker without having just opened it should be able to know by reading the title what they were doing and what is expected of them Secondly the titles should give a sense of flow and continuity to the process Overall the user reading the title of a picker should know where they are and what is expected of them The first one is a matter of sharp and accurate description For example a picker whose body is a calendar could have as a title Choose A Date This would be a bad title since a user reading this without remembering how they got there would not know what the date is for A much better header for a picker with a calendar could be Set Due Date With this title the user knows that the date is the due date for an invoice and not the date of emission or any other date In a vacuum it might seem like a very small difference but all of these little things aggregate to make the product enjoyable and easy to use With regards to flow and continuity the best way to ensure this is to put together each title with the copy of whatever it was that triggered this picker Thus using the due date example above Clicking on quotDuequot in the create invoice page opens a picker named quotDue inx2026quot and choosing quotspecific datequot results in quotset a due datequot So when writing the title for a picker always look at it side by side with what triggered it The body The body is less straightforward because it can include very many different elements Broadly though they can be divided in two categories x2013 x2018explanationx2019 copy and interactable elements The first type does not appear in all pickers x2013 only in cases where therex2019s need for clarification regarding the purpose of the picker The guidelines for these are quite simple In these cases remember that clarity is king You will not be adding this type of copy unless itx2019s an already fairly complex flow so the only goal of this copy should be clarity Forget personality forget casual tone and focus on being clear The second broad category of copy in the body of pickers are the different types of value selectors themselves These can take the form of checkboxes radio buttons calendars free text boxes and more For these the same overall rules apply Clarity especially in labels but also the options themselves is the main priority The buttons Finally the last element that appears on pickers are buttons These buttons are no different than the buttons everywhere else in the product so the same guidelines should be followed Read more at the buttons guidelines Continue reading about our UI Copy Guidelines on the Emails pagepickershtml3617 "},null,{"title":"Terminology &amp; Cheat Sheet","href":"design/copy/terms.html","content":" Terminology amp Cheat Sheet sticky display none important Terminology and Cheat Sheet The purpose of this section is to provide a condensed list of rules and terms for writing UI copy These are not specific or limited to certain parts of the product or elements in the UI but rather act as a set of broadly applicable rules In addition to this list of standard terms the rules that follow should help in writing good copy These rules are meant to be used by those planning on writing significant amounts of copy If youaposre interested in very specific aspects for example error messages you should look for those specific guides These rules will not miraculously help you write amazing copy if writing is just not for you though so if this is the case get someone else to help Remember that writing copy is very much a skill and knowing english is not enough Treat copywriting with respect and you will have a greater chance of coming up with something great Leave it until the last minute or as an afterthought and the end result will reflect this Do use Do not use Reason Connection Contact We focus on action and relationships Connection is action oriented while contact is static Recipient Receiver A receiver refers to a machine while a recipient is the correct term when talking about people invoice Invoice Do not capitalize words in the middle of a sentence wants to connect with you wants to join your network joining a network is ambiguous The action is to connect and networks are then formed organically Connection request Network request We focus on the action which is the connection network is ambiguous Document status Document state Status is generally understood in business state is tech jargon StatusVoid StatusVoided Voided is only the past tense of the verb to void and never an adjective Supplier Vendor Both are fine we have chosen supplier as a matter of consistency Validate Transcribe Transcribing connotes a time consuming and arduous task At Tradeshift we use clever technology to do these things so there is no need to transcribe x2013 only review and validate Validator Reviewer see above Processing in queue Processing indicates motion and progress whilst in queue signifies lack thereof Always attempt to include subject verb and articles in a sentence This is so that copy does not sound like a robot Sentences like x201CError importing filex201D are technically correct but do not convey meaning well Being technically correct is not enough copy needs to read as a person explaining something to another Never sacrifice clarity in order to sound casual Copy should be whenever possible casual natural and friendly but clarity remains the top priority Be specific and precise with your word choice quotSearchquot isnquott the same as quotfilterquot quotsendquot might not be the same as quotsubmitquot and quotcancelquot is not the same as quotgo backquot Particularly in actionoriented copy make absolutely sure that what you say is what you mean to say Avoid overusing jargon and be very wary of abbreviations Following design principles Tradeshift is a product with a very wide user base and is not expected to be a primary working tool As such copy should aim to inform users with a very wide variety in knowledge Of course sometimes it is impossible to avoid jargon but consider it carefully Abbreviations on the other hand are almost never OK quotSitequot should be quotWebsitequot quotInfoquot should be quotInformationquot and quotInvitequot should be quotInvitationquot Donquott fall for the quotpeople donapost readquot trap This has been repeated as a mantra for a very long time but UX experts across the board agree that this is not true Specially when it comes to headers and buttons users read Do not allow copy to be steered by this assumption Avoid using passive voice Passive voice invoice was sent by you creates awkward sentences where the subject is deemphasized Unless the intention is specifically to do this do NOT use passive voice Do not leave copywriting to the last minute Writing copy is a task like any other and requires time thought and effort to come up with a good result If you leave it until the last minute it is going to be bad If you write the first thing that comes to mind and call it a day it is going to be bad So instead of filling a design with Lorem Ipsum start working on the copy as an integral part of the design and iterate on it like you would anything else Continue reading about our UI Copy Guidelines on the Error Messages page "},{"title":"Principles","href":"design/index.html","content":" Principles sticky display none important Principles By taking the following eight principles into account when building a Tradeshift application youx2019ll maximize your chances of creating a good user experience For most people Tradeshift is not their primary work tool It means that these people will only use Tradeshift occasionally Hence we generally donx2019t consider the user an expert user and the core parts of Tradeshift have been designed with this in mind This doesnx2019t mean we cannot or shouldnx2019t provide powerful interfaces that cater to experienced users though By adapting the interface through a userx2019s repeated use and providing powerful shortcuts expert users will be able to experience a productivity boost 1 Remember usersx2019 choices Users often need to repeat their work tasks Make sure to remember the usersx2019 previous choices and inputs to support future choices If at all possible automate the mundane tasks Adjust defaults with used values Provide access to previously used values Whenever applicable ask the user if the used values should be new defaults When a user starts using Tradeshift the list of currency options contains one suggested currency the one used in the company registration country If the user uses another currency this newly used currency will appear as an option the next time the user needs to fill out the currency value This way lists of regularly used values are created Opposite principle Always providing the same ground zero to users no matter when or how many times the user has used your application Simultaneously clearing previously used values This may be relevant in other types of applications where values are never reused or where different users share one account 2 Build learning into the UI Consistent use of the design patterns provided in this guide is important to support the usersx2019 learning and recognition Reuse and consistent use will give the user the ability to apply knowledge from one functional area to another lowering the cognitive load and increasing performance So do only invent new design patterns when absolutely necessary Reuse design patterns to provide an experience of recognition Be mindful of the usersx2019 first run experience Learning to work with dynamic option lists in the context of selecting a unit type here aided by a first run embedded description creates knowledge about how to solve other tasks The currency selector uses the same design pattern as the unit type selector The user can now leverage previous experience since the designs are based on the same pattern Opposite principle Individual applications on mobile phones especially games are often wildly different to establish individual identity and to better optimize to very narrow tasks supported by that specific app But since allmost Tradeshift apps are extensions all related to the core consistency is chosen 3 Keep users in task solution mode People come to Tradeshift to work with their business data and flows x2013 not to work with buttons inputs or manuals Keeping the users in the functional flows is important Avoid forcing the user to outofcontext settings pages to change things that could be adjusted incontext Provide sensible defaults that potentially prevent the user from wanting to change a setting in the first place Further avoid forcing the user to read FAQs and manuals out of context Be mindful of the usersx2019 first run experience Whenever a user intends to export Tradeshift data make sure you know why If you can provide a view of the data or functionality thatx2019d keep the user in the flow the user gets a better experience and your product is better Avoid settings pages Keep help descriptions in the app not outside Understand why and when the users want to export application data Consider if an improvement could solve the need Example Letting the user update address and company registration information from the public profile page makes settings pages for these details unnecessary Opposite principleEncouraging the user to spend significant time understanding your app properly before using it Eg by letting the user read a manual and a separate getting started guide Then still before use configuring the product for correct use Many medicalhealthcare products work this way as improper understanding can be dangerous Quickbooks is an example of a settings heavy application as well x2013 but it seems Intuit is moving away from this approach as it clearly Tradeshiftaposs internal tests show makes initial use harder 4 Mobile first Global reach includes users who are not primarily working in front of a computer all day Itx2019s users whox2019re working on the road and even users who donx2019t ever have access to a laptopdesktop computer Most often itx2019s valuable thinking the mobile use cases first x2013 itx2019ll improve the experience for all other users Given the diversity of the markets Tradeshift is made available in and the shift towards mobile in more mature markets donx2019t underestimate the mobile scenarios Consider the mobile use cases first Be optimistic when considering the mobile use cases Be aware that many Tradeshift users will have both a regular computer and a mobile device Some will not have a computer ExampleMany users check their email continuously on their smartphone A primary vehicle for notifying users and getting users to complete tasks in Tradeshift rely on email as communication channel x2013 such as when a new invoice is received Allowing smooth transition from an email notification telling about the received invoice to actually accepting or rejecting the invoice on the same device allows the user to react faster Also the user doesnx2019t need to mark the email as unread or otherwise flag it to see it on a desktop computer later Opposite principleExpert systems where users are expected to work on a computer in a known locationsetting and where the user is not pulled into the application via eg email notifications While we do have this kind of applications on the platform the majority of future features integrate tightly into email and the ability to respond from these 5 Help the user focus Establish a visual hierarchy on you application pages that support the prioritized features the page is intended to present Most used features get dominant colors positions and sizes while less used features are visually downprioritized The design patterns are created to guide you to doing this Make sure to only present the data the user needs to make decisions at any given time Avoid just rendering out all the data you have just because you have it Render out only the data necessary for your use cases Establish a clear visual hierarchy optimized for the use cases you intend to solve The prioritization you do when designing your app is cognitive load you lift off the end usersx2019 shoulders Opposite principle Specialistexpert systems used daily by users can typically present more data information and actions than nonexpert occasionally used systems The expert user has plenty time to master complex interfaces and will eventually receive intensive product training So in those cases intricate shortcuts and an abundance of information in large tables can be empowering Many Tradeshift users though are often occasional users whose primary profession is normally not within the functional areas covered by Tradeshift eginvoice creator enterprise invoice coder x2026 6 Provide a sense of context Whenever the user navigates your application make sure to provide enough visual clues that the user understands where and why he arrived at a certain screen Buttons with explanatory text is one solution Animations to explain the scene changes is another solution Stacking pickers is an example of this The visual stacking provides a trail back while each layer appears in a way that supports the same concept Think beforeafter states into any action Use clues such as animation to show how one item relates to another Opposite principle Expert systems again x2013 or alternatively text based systems such as DOS prompt or Terminal Here the visual clues have been almost completely omitted and rely on the user to contain and know context 7 If it looks easy itx2019s easier to get started Tradeshift encourages use by having an interface that looks easy to use Instruments such as slightly oversized elements and typography plenty of whitespace clear colors simple iconography must all be considered when laying out your application Avoid things like overcrowding areas unnecessary divider lines stacking content closely microtypography and unaligned elements Use a visualUI designer if in doubt Spend time ensuring your application screens are well laid out and correspond with Tradeshiftx2019s UI guidelines Reevaluate all elements presented in your application UI and consider if they need to be there to let the user make decisions and actions Use a UI designer to get the visuals right if in doubt Opposite principle Heavier applications such as 3D software or even games can allow a steeper learning curve as users both need all functionality at their fingertips all the time much less linear flow of actions and time and interest in feature discovery isnx2019t unexpected 8 Do enduser testing No heuristics in the world can replace enduser testing Get to know the truth about the target usersx2019 ability to interact with your app Improve when necessary Opposite principle When building internal tools where the users are within arms reach The benefits of having direct access to every user can eliminate the need for classical enduser testing as the product in use is the actual testing Continue reading our Design Guidelines on the UI Structure page

Buttons sticky display none important Buttons A collection of button styles exist to visually prioritize the possible actions in your application Styles include the color size and position of the buttons Applying these button styles correctly will help the user focus on the most likely next action By prioritizing the user flows in your application you will know which flows are most likely to be used by the majority of users One way of making these most likely paths clear to the users is by applying the appropriate button styles Four main button styles exist Primary button The most likely

repeatedly afraid of clicking proceed during a complex task involving multiple documents as they were not sure whether proceed would take them to the next step in the current document or to the next

menu items Only specify your global menu item as a shortcut if frequent and repeated access to your functionality on mobile devices is necessary Contextual menu The contextual menu the area above the main content area can be customized in a few different ways Buttons for contextual actions When using the contextual bar to present actions these actions must always be highest level actions to whatx2019s on the page Ie actions that manipulate the entirety of the contents The invoice creation example has document delete save and send as contextual actions These actions modify the entirety of whatx2019s on the page More finegrained controls such as adding lines belong to the contents of the document and should never appear in the contextual bar as actions An alternative example connector app and connections page is when the page contains a collection of objects In this case the contextual action of adding another object to the collection is allowed as contextual action as it alters the collection being the highest level on that kind of page Tabbed navigation The contextual bar can also contain tabs with the purpose of splitting related contents into subsections that can be processed individually in any given order An example is this documentation Progresstabbed navigation When a tabbed navigation is preferred but therex2019s a requirement for users to process all tabs in order the progresstabbed contextual bar is used Note that the progresstabbed navigation leaves ample space for a flow headline by keeping the progress tabs below the contextual bar space Progresstabbed navigation works well for setup flows where all steps are required such as a custom registration flow Filtering and searching For managing complex lists the contextual bar can be completely exchanged with search and filter functionality This is especially usable for long lists such as the documents list pages Hidden When the contextual bar doesnt do anything it can be completely removed Note that in phone size UI theres always a bar containing the current pages title Combinations Its not recommended to combine the above mentioned contextual bar types For instance
