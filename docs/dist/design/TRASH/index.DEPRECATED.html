                    <p>These guidelines describe the foundational principles and concepts that will get you up to speed designing great Tradeshift apps.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <p>By paying attention to these guidelines and by doing proper end-user testing you&#x2019;ll maximize the chances of users finding your application easy and pleasurable to use. It&#x2019;s recommended to spend some time familiarizing
                        yourself with Tradeshift before you start designing your own app.</p>
                    <p>We&apos;re on a mission to democratise business. We do this by:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Providing equal access to value: Any professional should have equal access to the powerful business platform for dealing with customers, suppliers and business partners. Tradeshift&#x2019;s functionality is not exclusive and we
                            always aim to provide the same benefits to all users &#x2013; independent of company size, geography or users&#x2019; skills and means of accessing the internet (device independence).</li>
                        <li>Being global: Business trade and collaborate with business everywhere. Keeping a global mindset while building your application can prevent artificially limiting its value and usefulness.</li>
                        <li>Supporting and empowering people: People make up companies. Supporting people means eliminating trivial tasks that technology does better, and freeing up people to what they do better: Collaborate, evaluate and make decisions.
                            The pleasure of using Tradeshift comes through this balance.</li>
                    </ul>
