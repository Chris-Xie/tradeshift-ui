	+ 'We do this by:\n'
	+ '\n'
	+ '* Providing equal access to value: Any professional should have equal access to the powerful business platform for dealing with customers, suppliers and business partners. Tradeshift’s functionality is not exclusive and we always aim to provide the same benefits to all users – independent of company size, geography or users’ skills and means of accessing the internet (device independence).\n'
	+ '* Being global: Business trade and collaborate with business everywhere. Keeping a global mindset while building your application can prevent artificially limiting its value and usefulness.\n'
	+ '* Supporting and empowering people: People make up companies. Supporting people means eliminating trivial tasks that technology does better, and freeing up people to what they do better: Collaborate, evaluate and make decisions. The pleasure of using Tradeshift comes through this balance.\n'
